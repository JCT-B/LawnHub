                <li>Complex Package Management – Different distros, different tools (apt, yum, pacman).</li>
                <li>Permissions & Root Access – Sudo, chmod, chown can be confusing.</li>
                <li>Troubleshooting via Terminal – Logs and debugging require CLI skills.</li>
                <li>Lack of GUI for Advanced Tasks – System settings often need text-based configs.</li>
                <li>Syntax Sensitivity – Small mistakes in commands or config files can break the system.</li>

                <li>Open-Source Nature – Anyone can modify and create their own version.</li>
                <li>Different Use Cases – Distros are tailored for servers, desktops, embedded systems, hacking, gaming, etc.
                </li>
                <li>Varied User Preferences – Some prefer minimal systems (Arch, Gentoo), others want ease of use (Ubuntu, Mint).</li>
                <li>Different Package Managers – Debian-based (apt), Red Hat-based (dnf/yum), Arch-based (pacman).</li>
                <li>Diverse Desktop Environments – GNOME, KDE, XFCE, etc., leading to multiple flavors of the same distro.
                </li>
                <li>Corporate vs. Community Support – Some distros are enterprise-focused (RHEL, SUSE), while others are community-driven (Debian, Arch).</li>
                <li>Experimentation & Innovation – Developers create new distros to test new features, performance, or security models.</li>

                <li>Windows Dominance – Most developers prioritize Windows due to its large user base.</li>
                <li>Limited Vendor Support – Some software companies don't develop of Linux versions due to low it’s OS market share.</li>
                <li>Lack of Official Drivers – Some GPU and hardware vendors optimize for Windows first.</li>
                <li>Reliance on Emulation – Tools like Wine and Proton help, but not all games/apps work well.</li>
